This is the git repo behind my personal site, hosted at [jackmorrison.xyz](https://jackmorrison.netlify.app)

Current status:
[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/3289fe4d-7b66-4f01-991c-74cc3e12074f/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/jackmorrison/deploys)

## 🛠 How it's built

The site is built using **Gatsby**, and hosted using **Netlify**.

## 🎨 Can I use this

Sure! This website is completely open source. The only thing I ask is that you link to my [sources page](https://jackmorrison.netlify.app/credits) so that the sources I've used are credited, as well as myself! ☺️

## 🚀 How to use the site

1.  **Clone the repo**

    If you want to use some of the git hooks I've set up (to automatically generate site stats), run the following:

    ```shell
    npm run repo-init
    ```

1.  **Install Gatsby CLI**

    Install the Gatsby CLI globally

    ```shell
    npm install -g gatsby-cli
    ```

1.  **Start developing**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd personal-site/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

1.  **Hosting**

    Follow [this great tutorial](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/02/24/a-step-by-step-guide-gatsby-on-netlify/) to publish your site to Netlify!
