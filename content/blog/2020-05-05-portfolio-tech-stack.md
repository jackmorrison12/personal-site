# Developing my Ideal Personal Portfolio Website


## Part 2: Choosing my Tech Stack

One thing I new for this iteration of my personal website was that I was going to research my tech stack a lot more thoroughly than I had before.

### Framework

So I knew I wanted my site to be fast, and so I thought about using s static site generator. I've experimented with Jekyll in the past, and loved how easy it was to pick up, but always felt very limited with what I could do. I had a look around at some frameworks and came across Hugo, Gatsby, Next.js and Nuxt.js (it took me a while to realise the latter two were actually different frameworks). After reading more into them, I knew it was between Gatsby and Hugo, since they seemed to be the most popular, and I wanted something which would have a relatively large user base and good documentation.

I ended up trolling a few [reddit threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/b0j9rs/infographic_gatsby_vs_hugo_vs_jekyll/) in order to get some honest reviews, and ultimately decided on Gatsby. This was mainly because it was built on top of React, which I'm now very familiar with, and Hugo is built using Go, which I've only touched briefly. Gatsby also seemed to have more extensions and plugins, which seemed like it could be useful in my quest to not create everything from scratch.

### CSS

My next step was to find out which option would be best fo styling. I'd previously only ever written CSS as I was going along, having transition to using Sass in my most recent attempt at my personal site.

I looked into a few options: Bulma, Tailwind and (of course) Bootstrap. I'd only ever heard of the latter, and pretty quickly realised it was not what I wanted for my design ideas. I looked into more detail at Bulma and Tailwind; Bulma seemed to look very easy to use, being based on Flex, but Tailwind seemed to be much more customisable.
