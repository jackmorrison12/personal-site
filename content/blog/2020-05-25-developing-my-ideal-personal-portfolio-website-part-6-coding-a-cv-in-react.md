Everyone has a CV, and I've had many iterations over the years. Most recently, I'd been using [FlowCV](https://flowcv.io/) to build mine. This was working really well, however it was a pain to update. Every time I changed something, I had to log in, change the details, check the layout still worked and fix if needed, download the PDF, then upload this to my site and rebuild. It was a long process, and I wanted to streamline it. I already had basically all of the content for my CV on my site, so I thought, why not use it?
