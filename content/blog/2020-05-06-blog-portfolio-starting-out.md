Now I've decided what tech I want to use, but where do I start? Starting off a project always seems daunting, especially when you've never used the technologies before, but I find that a good tutorial can get you up to grips and feeling confident quickly.

\## The Initial Setup\
\
The first thing I did was find a \[good tutorial on how to use Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/), and read through it. I didn’t actually code it out, since it was well written and easy to follow. Once I’d done this, I went back and did the initial Gatsby setup. I then followed \[this tutorial](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/02/24/a-step-by-step-guide-gatsby-on-netlify/) to connect it to Netlify, and got my basic ‘Hello World’ page deploying.

## Styling

I then wanted to get some basic styling out of the way, so I added some Sass files which I’d found online (the links to which can be found at the tops of the files). I then tried using them to create a hero banner on my homepage, just to get used to how they worked. I also used \[this article](https://sld.codes/articles/How-I-Added-Dark-Mode-In-20-Lines) to help me implement dark mode, so I didn’t have to stare at a light screen whilst developing!

\## Adding Content

The next stage was setting up the CMS.
