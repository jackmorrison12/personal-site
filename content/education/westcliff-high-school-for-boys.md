I had a great time at WHSB whilst I was studying for my A Levels. I moved here because my old school didn't offer Computer Science as an A Level, and I thought it was what I wanted to pursue. However, thanks to my Computing teacher (should out Mr Rahman), I knew it was for me.

I started working on some programming projects whilst I was here (you can see one attempt on my projects page, if you can call it that), but I knew that I just wanted to keep trying and get better.

At Sixth Form, I was a prefect, and helped to tutor maths students in the lower years, because I wanted to give back to the community which helped me so much.
