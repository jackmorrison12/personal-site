If you've made it this far, then you really are doing a thorough search. Back in school, I wasn't really sure what I wanted to do. To be honest, I didn't really know what Computing was. It wasn't until I was choosing my GCSEs that I saw it was an option. Speaking to my ICT teacher, she told me she didn't think I'd be able to handle Computing, so I decided to prove her wrong. So yes, I am where I am today out of pure spite. However, I do have to thank her, because I think it's been quite successful this far.
