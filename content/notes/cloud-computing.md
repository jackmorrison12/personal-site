# Introduction

On the internet, we have what is known as 'big data'

This is large volume of data coming at a high velocity, with a large variety

This is a challenge for traditional IT systems, so it's supported by moving computing to the cloud

## What is a Cloud?

This is data centre hardware and software that the vendors use to offer computing resources and services on demand

It's a large pool of easily usable virtualised computing resources, development platforms and applications

It provides a layer of abstraction to the actual resources which are being provided

## What is Cloud Computing?

This is the delivery of computing as a service, where the shared resources, software and data are provided to users by a provider as a metered service over a network

## Pros and Cons

User's benefits:

- Speed - services are provided on demand
- Global scale and elasticity
- Productivity
- Performance and Security
- customisability

User's concerns:

- Dependency on the network and internet connectivity
- Security and privacy
- Cost of migration
- Cost and risk of vendor lock-in (once you choose a vendor, it's hard to change)

## Types of Cloud Computing

Public cloud:

- All hardware, software and other supporting infrastructure is owned and operated by cloud vendors
- Cloud vendors offer their computing resources over the internet
- Examples are Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Services

Private Cloud:

- Cloud computing infrastructure is used exclusively by a single business or organisation, meaning it can be better tailored to the requirements needed
- Services and infrastructure are maintained on a private network

Hybrid Cloud:

- This combines public and private clouds: it allows data and applications to be shared between them
- It gives a business greater flexibility to optimise existing infrastructure, security and compliance

## Cloud Service Models

### Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)

This is where a user can rent IT infrastructure, such as servers and virtual machines, storage, networks, firewalls and security

It has immediately available computing infrastructure, provisioned and managed by the service provider

Computing resources are pooled together to serve multiple users/tenants

###Â Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)

This where a user can get an on-demand environment for development, testing and management of software applications - servers, storage, network OS, databases etc

This is a container platform, not a VM

Some examples are Google App Engine, Windows Azure, Oracle Cloud Platform and Amazon Web Services

### Function-as-a-Service (FaaS)

This overlaps with a PaaS, but focusses on building app functionality without managing the servers and infrastructure requires to do so

The cloud vendor provides set-up, capacity planning and server management

The app is decoupled from where it is executed

### Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)

This is where software application can be delivered over the internet on demand

The cloud vendor handles software application and underlying infrastructure, and handles any maintenance (e.g. upgrades and patches)

Some examples are Google docs, Dropbox, Slack and Office 365
