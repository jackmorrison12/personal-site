# Introduction

Anonymisation is hard

Once we pseudonymise a dataset, we need to:

1. <mark>Protect it against attacks</mark>, such as: uniqueness, homogeneity, semantic and skewness
2. ... by <mark>anonymising it once and only one</mark>
3. ... all while <mark>preserving utility</mark> for all current and future uses!

## What is Big Data?

A loose definition is <mark>any data which doesn't fit in an excel spreadsheet</mark> (like track & trace data @ukgovt ðŸ‘€)

# Unicity

## Uniqueness to Unicity

## Generalisation

# Matching Attacks

# Profiling Attacks

# Unstructured Data
