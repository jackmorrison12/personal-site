Last term at uni, before the whole world was forced into lockdown, I was a teaching assistant at The Coopers' Company and Coborn School in Upminster. I wanted to write about my experience teaching, what techniques and resources I used, and some of the things I learned.

_As a quick sidenote, I gave a [presentation](/files/ccsis-presentation.pdf) and wrote a [detailed report](/files/ccsis-report.pdf), which this article will be summarising, if you'd like to read more! (They're both anonymised for GDPR compliance). I also have all of the resources mentioned linked on my [me page](/me) under 'teaching'. (I'm working on making these sections linkable currently!)_

So back to it! I taught the basics of Python Programming to a class of Year 10s for 6 weeks. They already had a basic knowledge of Python, so I was tasked with expanding upon this, by teaching them topics such as 2D Arrays, For and While Loops, Functions and Built-in Methods.

I started my first few sessions observing the class to get a few ideas on teaching styles, and got to work planning. I wanted to follow an <span class="is-red">**iterative technique**</span>, where I'd plan a lesson, execute it, gather feedback, and use this to adapt the next lesson.

I started off with a lesson on Arrays, where I gave a presentation followed by some worksheets we worked through. I quickly learned that the lecture-worksheet style of teaching didn't work well, since students would forget things I taught pretty quickly.

So, the next week, I broke up my lecture into topics, and interspersed questions. This worked better, but I found it hard to regain their <span class="is-red">**attention**</span> for the presentations. This meant that the next week, I shortened my presentations to only the key information, and focused on giving more help to those student who needed it when doing the worksheets.

One big problem I was facing was that students didn't have enough <span class="is-red">**motivation**</span> to do the work - <span class="is-red">**it wasn't fun enough!**</span> I spoke to some of them, and they suggested introducing <span class="is-red">**competition**</span>, like in Kahoot, would make them engage more.

Therefore, over the week in between, I set up a system which could receive answers sent from the students, and would tell them how well their code worked, giving them points, and would show it on a leaderboard. I made this using Google Colab and Heroku Dyno, and more information on how it worked can be found in my [report](/files/ccsis-report.pdf).

I'd now gotten them much more engaged, but had made the <span class="is-red">**content**</span> too hard! So the next week, I made the questions much easier, and then get harder as the worksheet progressed, to cater towards the more capable students. Finally, I found a teaching technique which worked for this class!

Obviously it took a few weeks, but I think by using an iterative method of changing my style based on feedback each week, I got to a good teaching structure pretty quickly.

So some of my biggest challenges were:

- <span class="is-red">**Keeping Students Engaged!**</span> - I tried many things to engage the kids, such as easier questions, but competition was the biggest motivator which got them to participate
- <span class="is-red">**Feedback**</span> - Getting good feedback started as a challenge, and using forms isn't the best way to get info from teens, so I'd just observe and chat with them to see what was working and what wasn't
- <span class="is-red">**Differing Skill Levels**</span> - Initially, I struggles to cater to the whole class, but eventually it all came down to getting feedback, and also just practice making questions

If I had to give three main things I learned, each in one sentence, I'd say:

1. <span class="is-red">**Interested**</span> students learn <span class="is-red">**better**</span>
2. You <span class="is-red">**canâ€™t**</span> make <span class="is-red">**everyone**</span> passionate about CS
3. Teaching is<span class="is-red"> **hard**</span>

I had a great time teaching, and it's something I love to do, and would love to keep doing / help others to start out!

I did a lot more than just teaching **this course** whilst at Coopers, and if you're interested or have questions then please reach out or read my [report](/files/ccsis-report.pdf)!
