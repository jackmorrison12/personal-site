I taught a course on the basics of Python Programming to some Year 10 students at The Coopers' Company and Coborn School in Upminster. This was as part of my module 'Communication Computer Science in Schools'.

They already had a basic knowledge of Python, so I expanded upon this by teaching them topics such as 2D Arrays, For and While Loops, Functions and Built-in Methods.

You can see a detailed report of my experience at the school linked above, along with the presentation I gave about my time there. As you'll see, I enjoyed my experience very much, and I learned a lot about how to communicate effectively, and convey technical knowledge to people.

I created lots of teaching resources for my course, including a system to allow students to compete at coding challenges, which was a combination of HackerRank and Kahoot. More detail on this, along with a technical implementation, can be found in the report above. All of my slides, worksheets and other teaching resources can also be found on this page, if you're wanting to learn Python yourself! Please feel free to use them if you would like, and let me know how you find them - I'd love to hear if they come in useful!
