This module teaches how to practice state-of-the-art attacks against privacy-preserving mechanisms and systems, as well as defence mechanisms and their trade-offs. 

Some topics include: anonymisation strategies for small and big data datasets and their limits; query-based systems; Differential Privacy; building privacy-preserving services using cryptographic methods and analysing privacy policies using formal methods.
