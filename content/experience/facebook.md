Back in 2018, I participated in Facebook's Hack-a-Project scheme , where I was put in a group with 2 other Computing students, and we had to create a project with the aim of 'Bringing Communities Together'. We decided to create a mentoring app with a twist - it wasn't a paid application, instead it was more of a trade. We called it 'Mentorme'. You had to mentor someone in something and they'd do the same for you. It allowed people of all ages and abilities to connect.

I learnt lots of new technologies, including React, MongoDB, NodeJS and Docker, which I have used in more projects since, including this site you're on right now!

More information on this project can be found on my project page.
