I was a tutor of Computing and Mathematics for A Level students alongside my studies.

Through doing this, I gained a lot of insight into different teaching styles and how to keep younger students engaged and interested. This is something which I find really interesting, and continued further by taking a module in my third year of uni called 'Communication Computer Science in Schools', where I got to teach a class of GCSE students programming. More info on this can be found on my projects page.
