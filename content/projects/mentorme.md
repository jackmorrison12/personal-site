We created a project as part of the Facebook Hack-a-Project with the aim of "Bringing Communities Together". Our application is a mentoring application which allows people with valuable skills and experiences to trade that knowledge for knowledge from others. It was built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js).
