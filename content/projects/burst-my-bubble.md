The internet is a powerful tool for connecting people but it hasn't necessarily brought us closer together. Sites are removing their comments sections in droves, with news feeds full of think pieces about the state of debate online. One cause of this downturn in decency is how easy the internet makes it to disregard opposing arguments. Our own 'confirmation bias' means we're more likely to reading something that challenges our beliefs and content delivery algorithms on the internet have a vested interest in showing us what we like. It's becoming increasingly easy to live in a bubble (see what we did there?).

The goal of 'Burst My Bubble' was to create a news feed with a difference; to encourage variety so people had a more broad consumption of the news. We use RSS feeds to aggregate articles from a wide variety of news feeds, and along with the user's reading history, we curate a diverse and confronting personalised news feed.

Users can share their thoughts on articles, but instead of the traditional comments and replies format, can instead only write one opinion, which they're free to edit as their point of view matures.

Users also have access to a personal page, which shows their latest reading stats, as well as recently read articles.

We also showed the top trending topics on Burst My Bubble, so you're not just limited to articles which are tailored to you, since the app is all about expanding your horizons!

Burst My Bubble was awarded second best project for the year.

We wrote the frontend of the application using React, and used Python and Java for the backend. We also used a MongoDB database.
