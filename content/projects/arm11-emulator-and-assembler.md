This project was completed in the final term of my first year undergraduate studies. It entailed creating an ARM11 Emulator and Assembler in C, then using these in combination with a Raspberry Pi to control an LED.

Unfortunately the code for the emulator and assembler cannot be shared here as the task will be reused in future years.
