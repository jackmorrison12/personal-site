<div class="intro">

Over the last decade or so, the use of streaming services has skyrocketed, and a key time people listen to this music is when exercising.

However, it's hard to find the ideal songs to listen to when working out.

This project was part of my MEng Computing degree at Imperial College London. The [full report](/files/osti-report.pdf) details all of this in more depth.

Thanks to my supervisor [Professor William Knottenbelt](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/w.knottenbelt) for assistance during this project.
