This project was mainly undertaken during the second year of my A Level Computing studies, with the task to create a mobile application.

I decided to create an app which could generate random GCSE-level mathematics questions for students so that they could test their knowledge. It could also check to see if their answers were correct, and had other features such as a leaderboard with friends, and streaks to encourage daily use. I made the application for iOS devices, and so had a lot of experience with the Swift programming language and XCode. This project was a fun way of teaching myself a new programming language from scratch, as I was never taught it in a formal environment. This meant I became used to using manuals for the language to look up syntax and specific features of the language, which was a great learning experience.
