1. ## Clone the repo

If you want to use some of the git hooks I've set up (to

automatically generate site stats), run the following:

`shell npm run repo-init`

2. ## Install Gatsby CLI

Install the Gatsby CLI globally

`shell npm install -g gatsby-cli`

3. ## Start developing

Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

```
cd personal-site

gatsby develop
```

4. ## Open the source code and start editing!

Your site is now running at

`http://localhost:8000!`

Note: You'll also see a second link:

`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`

This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql).

5. ## Hosting
