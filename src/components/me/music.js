        I've always loved listening to music, and in 2019 I decided I wanted to
        learn how to make it too. I took a course called{" "}

          Music Technology
        </a>
        .
        <br />
        We covered many topics, starting off with the basics of how to use a
        Digital Audio Workstation, such as creating sounds using software
        instruments and MIDI keyboards. We then moved on to learn things like
        mixing and using inserts and sends.
        <br />
        We used Cubase in class, however due to coronavirus, I had to teach
        myself how to use Logic Pro X in order to be able to create and submit
        my work.
        <br />
        For the course assessment, we had to create two compositions. You can
        find both of mine on this page, as well as some other things I created
        along the way!
