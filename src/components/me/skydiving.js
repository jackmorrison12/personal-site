                In 2019, I decided that I wanted to learn how to skydive, so I joined my Uni's <a className="btn" href="https://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/activities/a-to-z/skydiving">Skydiving Society</a>.
                <br />
                Unfortunately, due to Covid-19, I didn't get to go on the annual trip to start my AFF course <span role="img" aria-label="tear">ðŸ˜ª</span>. However I'm planning to start it this summer, so check back for updates!
                <br />
                I'm also the Skydiving Society Secretary for the 2020-21 year.
