However, tools for visual collaboration, such as through drawing, are currently lacking, with many suffering from lag, dropped connections or devices not syncing together correctly. \n We have created a resilient collaborative drawing app for iPadOS, using Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs), that aims to prevent failures as listed previously from becoming an issue.\nOur app, which is optimised for iPads, is called Canvas. Canvas allows users to connect and draw at the same time. Changes are propagated in real time, so if a user becomes temporarily disconnected, on reconnection, the changes that they made during this period will sync up. Canvas offers features such as shape recognition and bluetooth network optimisation.\nCRDTs are a class of abstract data types that allow their state to be distributed across devices, modified locally and then merged in a straight-forward manner, meaning that they guarantee eventual consistency. Therefore, Canvas is completely de-centralised, so does not rely on one of the nodes to always be connected. CRDTs are currently an open research area, so this project started as a proof of concept to show that they could be used in this context. \nSince this was an iPadOS app, we created it in XCode, using Swift 5.",

Sites are removing their comments sections in droves, with news feeds full of think pieces about the state of debate online. One cause of this downturn in decency is how easy the internet makes it to disregard opposing arguments. Our own 'confirmation bias' means we're more likely to reading something that challenges our beliefs and content delivery algorithms on the internet have a vested interest in showing us what we like. It's becoming increasingly easy to live in a bubble (see what we did there?).\nThe goal of 'Burst My Bubble' was to create a news feed with a difference; to encourage variety so people had a more broad consumption of the news. We use RSS feeds to aggregate articles from a wide variety of news feeds, and along with the user's reading history, we curate a diverse and confronting personalised news feed. Users can share their thoughts on articles, but instead of the traditional comments and replies format, can instead only write one opinion, which they're free to edit as their point of view matures.\nBurst My Bubble was awarded second best project for the year.\nWe wrote the frontend of the application using React, and used Python and Java for the backend. We also used a MongoDB database.",

However, it also gave us some new challenges we didn't expect, and really improved our knowledge of C.\n We created the machine by connecting the matrix to a Raspberry Pi, using a hat, and then built the box out of cardboard (and a lot of tape!).\n The game has 4 modes, one of which was an Artificial Intelligence, that was pretty good by the end of it. We also created all of our own sounds using GarageBand! You can see some live demos linked on this page.\nThis project won the prize for the best group project extension, judged by the creators of the Raspberry Pi themselves.",

We looked at Convolutional Neural Networks, along with Semantic Segmentation, as these are the most commmonplace in medical imaging. We then looked at overlapping topics, these being the uses of AI in radiology, and a deeper case study into the user for detection of lung cancer.\n Getting to know all of this information about AI was great, but we also had to present it in the form of a website. We had to create the site from scratch (without using a framework, such as Wordpress). We wrote the in Markdown, and used a Bash script (which invoked Pandoc) compiled it to HTML. Since we didn't use a web framework to write the CSS, it increased the challenge, but also meant that after the project, we had a more thorough understanding of CSS. Mobile optimisation was one particular challenge we found difficult. \n We won the prize for the best project in our category of AI in Medical Imaging, and second best project overall.",

This means that parients with chronic back pain are not getting the information they need to improve their posture and reduce their pain. Therefore, we decided to use an accelerometer and flex sensor to measure both upper and lower back position, in order to prevent both kinds of back pain with a single device. \n This resulted in Correct-a-Spine, an iOS app which can monitor and help you correct your posture to reduce back pain. \nThe app worked by connecting to an Ardino, which sent data via Bluetooth to the iOS device. Using this data, we could advise the user on how they should change their posture in order to reduce the risk of back pain. \nSince this was only a Hackathon project, we only created a rough v1, as you can see in the images, however if continued, Correct-a-Spine would incorporate machine learning in order to learn about its user and give them the best possible advice.

    "long_desc": "This project was completed as my Extended Project during my A Level studies, and discussed the controversy over computer-assisted proofs.\nAt the start of this project, I was unfamiliar with the area of computer-assisted proofs, and mathematical proofs in general for that matter. I decided on the topic because my mathematics teacher had discussed it in a lesson and I was curious to find out more. He mentioned that many mathematicians, to my surprise, did not agree that a theorem which had been proved using proof by exhaustion on a computer was legitimate. I did not understand their reasoning behind it not being a proof, because I presumed that if every case was proved to be true, then the proof would have to be valid. That is why I became interested in the subject, and when that chance to write a project on the topic arose, I decided I wanted to consider it further.",

    "long_desc": "This project was mainly undertaken during the second year of my A Level Computing studies, with the task to create a mobile application.\nI decided to create an app which could generate random GCSE-level mathematics questions for students so that they could test their knowledge. It could also check to see if their answers were correct, and had other features such as a leaderboard with friends, and streaks to encourage daily use. I made the application for iOS devices, and so had a lot of experience with the Swift programming language and XCode. This project was a fun way of teaching myself a new programming language from scratch, as I was never taught it in a formal environment. This meant I became used to using manuals for the language to look up syntax and specific features of the language, which was a great learning experience.",
