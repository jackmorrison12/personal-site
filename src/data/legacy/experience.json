    "desc": "I spent my summer of 2019 working at Nextjump as a Software Engineer. I worked on and took ownership of many large-scale projects, which were rolled out to millions of users. I primarily worked in PHP & Javascript, and wrote a lot of SQL. \n I also learnt a lot about workplace culture, running the London office's Adopt-a-School project. This was a place where I got to try out new ideas which could help me out with my work. For example, if I'm able to control a class of 20 screaming children, trying to get the attention of the office should be a breeze!",

This is something which I find really interesting, and continued further by taking a module in my third year of uni called 'Communication Computer Science in Schools', where I got to teach a class of GCSE students programming. More info on this can be found on my projects page.",

    "desc": "Back in 2018, I participated in Facebook's Hack-a-Project scheme , where I was put in a group with 2 other Computing students, and we had to create a project with the aim of 'Bringing Communities Together'. We decided to create a mentoring app with a twist - it wasn't a paid application, instead it was more of a trade. We called it 'Mentorme'. You had to mentor someone in something and they'd do the same for you. It allowed people of all ages and abilities to connect. \nI learnt lots of new technologies, including React, MongoDB, NodeJS and Docker, which I have used in more projects since, including this site you're on right now! \nMore information on this project can be found on my project page.",
